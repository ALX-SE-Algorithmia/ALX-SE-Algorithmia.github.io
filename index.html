		<h3>Our Journey</h3>
		<p>
		Daniel Dohou, of cohort 17, founded Algorithima SE, an
		open-source organization built mainly for ALX Software
		Engineering program students. Our main goal is to build
		real-life solutions as ALX SE students collaboratively. This
		will help to develop our problem solving skills and be more
		than just software engineers.
